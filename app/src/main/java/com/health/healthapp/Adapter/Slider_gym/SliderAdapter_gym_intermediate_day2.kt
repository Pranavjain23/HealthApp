        "Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing in toward each other, keeping your knees bent slightly. Engage your core and maintain a straight spine as you hinge forward at the waist, bringing your torso almost parallel to the floor. Keep your upper arms in close to your body and your head in line with your spine, tucking your chin in slightly. On an exhale, engage your triceps by straightening your elbows. Hold your upper arms still, only moving your forearms during this movement. Pause here, then inhale to return the weights to the starting position.",

        "Before you pick up a weight, stand with your arms at your sides and palms facing out. Our hands will be wider than shoulder width. That should be the strongest and most joint-friendly grip for you. Now load a barbell, either on the floor or, if youâ€™re training at home or in a mostly empty gym, the supports of a squat rack.",

        "Sit on the preacher bench with your feet firmly planted on the floor shoulder-width apart. Grip the dumbbells, barbell or machine in a supinated (underhand) grip. Your underarms should be positioned at the top of the pad. Lower the dumbbells, barbell or machine in a controlled manner until both of your elbows are fully extended. Then curl upward, keeping your shoulders and body stable throughout."
